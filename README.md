Feature
=======

A BDD syntax library.

* syntax: `given` A `and` B `when` C `then` D `unless` E `or` F `until` G 
* order does not matter
* nothing required (but it won't do much without a `then`)

* depends on https://github.com/ajacksified/Mediator.js or similar mediator implementation
* depends on html5 shims if needed (every, some, forEach)
